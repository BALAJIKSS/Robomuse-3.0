# Robomuse-3.0
The uploaded code was implemented on Robomuse 3.0 in IIT Delhi.This robot can roam in a given loop automatically and recognise human faces .                                                                                                  
While going in a predefined loop,the bot automatically changes to manual control when encountered an unknown obstacle in it's path.                     
Four ultrasonic sensors,two encoders,Sabertooth 2*12,Arduino Uno,Arduino MegaADK and Raspberry Pi were mounted on the bot.
